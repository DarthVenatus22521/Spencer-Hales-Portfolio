Multilayer Perceptron practice.ipynb: 

This project is a machine learning practice notebook exploring the use of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for binary classification.
The goal is to predict whether it will rain using a weather dataset while experimenting with:

Neural network architectures
Activation functions
Model performance comparison
Feature importance analysis

The notebook also compares the MLP model against traditional ML methods.
The notebook compares feature importance using:

Random Forest importance scores
Logistic Regression coefficients
Approximate MLP importance derived from input weights

This helps interpret which weather variables most influence rain prediction.

food.sql:

Code used to generate a sql database to practice running queries on.

food_sql_queries.txt

Contains questions about the database, queries used to gather the data, and output from the query.

Tableau practice.pdf:

PDF of a Tableau story containing a few dashboards that were created with SQL and Tableau tools.

Dice Project Report.qmd:

This project investigates whether the material of a die affects the outcomes of its rolls.
The study focuses on dice commonly used in tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons, where roll fairness and consistency are important.
The analysis was conducted using R and a two-way ANOVA framework.
The study examines:

Whether different types of dice (d4, d6, d20, etc.) behave differently
Whether there is an interaction effect between die type and material

The primary analysis used:
Two-way linear model with Type II ANOVA

This allowed testing of:
Main effect of Material
Main effect of Die Type
Interaction between Material and Die Type

Valentine.vbs:

A cute little script I wrote for my wife asking her to be my valentine. Saying no creates an endless loop of asking until she says yes.

ValentineEnhanced.vbs:

Removed the endless loop, after several no attempts I say I will take our puppy instead and end the script.
