This is a little game I coded up for fun, it requires 2 players as there is no CPU algorithm yet
It allows the users to play either a regular game of Tic Tac Toe or a game of Super Tic Tac Toe within the terminal.
At some point, I will make a nice visual that can be clicked on with a mouse.

Super Tic Tac Toe is a 3x3 tic tac toe board with a tic tac toe board within each space.
Player 1 will select which board to play on first.
When a position is selected, the next player needs to place their piece on the board that matches the position on the large board as the piece placed on the smaller board on the previous turn.
In the event the position chosen is the same as the board, play continues on that board.
When a player wins on a board, that spot on the large board is marked with their piece and can no longer be played into.
Selecting a position that is already won lets the next player pick which board they want to play on next.
When there are 3 matching winning boards in a row on the large board, that player wins!
